# Mozila-RCC-Soundscape-Project_IITG
The attached Python script implements a continuous soundscape monitoring and classification system designed for edge deployment on a Raspberry Pi. The system periodically records short audio segments using a USB microphone, applies basic preprocessing such as gain adjustment and normalization, and extracts MFCC-based acoustic features from the recorded audio. A pre-trained machine learning classifier is then used to categorize each audio segment into one of three soundscape classes: human, anthropogenic, or animal, along with a confidence score. The classification results are logged locally in a CSV file with timestamps for further analysis. Overall, the script enables autonomous, low-maintenance, real-time sound monitoring and data transmission suitable for long-term environmental deployments.
